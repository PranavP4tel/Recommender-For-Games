# Recommendation System For Games
In this project, a recommendation system has been created on the steam games dataset, which recommends games based on user inputs and similarity to other games.
The dataset contains information about game titles, publishers, developers, release date, price, categories, genres and much more.
Amongst the information provided for each game, only game titles, price, categories, genres and platforms have been used for the application.

Various approaches have been taken to create the system.

## 1. Filtering & Fuzzy Searching-
* A simple approach that takes a game title and provides the games with the highest scores by fuzzy searching (TheFuzz library).
* The results are also filtered by the categories and genres selected by the user.
  
## 2. Distance Measures -
* A new feature has been created in the dataset which combines the game information mentioned earlier into a single text description. This text description is converted into a sparse matrix using a TF-IDF Vectorizer.
* The user provides a game title, which is also converted into a vector. The distance of this input vector and all the other vectors in the sparse matrix is evaluated using Cosine Similarity, Manhattan Distance & Euclidean Distance.
* The recommendations by cosine similarity seem to work best since it works well on the sparse matrix generated by TF-IDF Vectorizer. These results are then returned to the user

## 3. Nearest Neighbors -
* sklearn.neighbors provides functionality for unsupervised and supervised neighbors-based learning methods. Here, the unsupervised learning method has been used employing the brute force algorithm and cosine similarity.
* It works similar to the distance measures approach since the distance calculation of the sparse matrix and the user input is conducted.
* You can read more about Nearest Neighbors here: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html

## 4. Search Engine Based - 
* This approach makes use of Rank-BM25 in Python to query the dataset against a game description entered by the user.
* An object of the BM25 class is created with the tokenized corpus (dataset).
* The user description is preprocessed and passed to the bm25 object to obtain the document scores. Documents with the highest scores are returned to the user filtered by price range entered by the user.
